                Mayra grew up in small town in the Sonora desert (where the temperature goes above 110 degrees). She spent four years exploring the insurance and mortgage business as a self-employee before moving to Florida. After moving to Florida (because she wanted to hang out with the gators and live close to the beach) she went back to school and finished her Bachelorâ€™s in Business Administration. One day, she woke up and decided to do something different with her life (because she was bored and wanted to learn a new skill) and joined the world's greatest air force The United States Air Force! (one of the best decisions she made).

                After completing her basic training and technical school; she served as Aircraft Armament Systems Technician (loaded bombs, missiles and cool stuff to Fighter Jets). A few years later, she moved to Texas (everything is bigger and better in Texas, right??) looking for new opportunities and she found them. She worked as an IT business analyst (where she found her love for Information Technology) and got promoted to IT project manager within the company. Since, she enjoyed living in Texas so much a new adventure knocked her door and cross-trained to a new military job within the Texas Air National Guard and spent some time in the state of Mississippi training to become a Cyber Warrior (fancy name for Air Force IT Support).
